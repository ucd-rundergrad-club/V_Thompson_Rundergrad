## dplyr basics

The functions:  
* Pick observations by their values (filter()).  
* Reorder the rows (arrange()).  
* Pick variables by their names (select()).  
* Create new variables with functions of existing variables (mutate()).  
* Collapse many values down to a single summary (summarise()).
